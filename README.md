The Bongo Cat Eurorack Module

## Hardware description
Adafruit Feather M0 Express powered by USB, connected to Adafruit 1.14" 240x135 Color TFT Display + MicroSD Card Breakout, with gate signal coming in through a voltage regulator (which probably isn't the best way to step down that voltage). 

This needs to use a different microcontroller so that it can be powered like a normal module and not USB. I'm currently experimenting with using a teensy 3.2.
